## What is DocMS API?
Document Management System (DocMS) API is a plugable and consumable backend service application that manages creation, modification and removal of Documents. It also manages the users on the platform, with roles and categories, users can seive out what to veiw, to be viewed, and otherwise. 
Documents can be restricted by access (private, public and role based) which gives users the opportunity to create personal documents and release them when they choose to.
Documents that are viewed by users can be liked or disliked, to give creators a brief feed on document's expectations.

This version of DocMS API does not support conversations or comments on documents.
