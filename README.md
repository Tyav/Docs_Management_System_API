Documents can be restricted by access (private, public and role based) which gives users the opportunity to create personal documents and release them when they choose to.
Documents that are viewed by users can be liked or disliked, to give creators a brief feed on document's expectations.

This version of DocMS API does not support conversations or comments on documents.
